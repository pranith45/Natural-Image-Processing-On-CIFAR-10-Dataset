# Natural-Image-Processing-On-CIFAR-10-Dataset
Natural Image Processing on CIFAR-10 using CNN with data augumentation, CNN without data augumentation, MLP, Random Forest models

                                        How to get to our project
● Download the .ipynb file provided in the zip folder.

● Open google colaboratory on any web browser.

● Upload that ipynb file on that collab note book.

● You can see all the code in blocks and their results.

● If you want to rerun the code then press ctrl+enter to run a particular block and ctrl
+ F9 to run the whole colab notebook at once.(not suggested as it may take a lot of
time to run the whole colab notebook)

                                    Structure and Process of Execution
● Our project is on Natural image classification over the Cifar-10 dataset which
contains 32*32 size pictures of 10 different classes having 6000 images per class.

● We tried different classifiers and finally used three different classifiers which are
Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron and Convolution neural network.

● We used different methods to increase the accuracy of the classifiers by using grid
search, varying number of epochs and data augmentation etc.

● Structure : Program consists of 4 models, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron,
CNN without data augmentation and CNN with data augmentation.

● The best result Comes out for the CNN model with data augmentation which is
approx 82%.
